<p><b>Description</b></p>
  <p>A Python application to track food waste and dial in ordering for restaurants. It uses the Google
  Sheets API and runs calculations to get averages for each dayâ€™s leftover food items. Files are
  created with the raw data and calculations for the month. The application then resets the Google
  Spreadsheets for the next month and data cells are cleared out.</p>
